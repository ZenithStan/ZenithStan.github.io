<h1> #HeyThat'sNotZenith </h1>
<h1> and how it effects you </h1>

<p> Have you ever wondered why Zenith hasn't slept with you yet? </p>
<p> I wonder this every day, as it's unrelated to today's topic I thought I would throw it out there... </p>

<p> Zenith's community is plauged, with a pathogen so foul that even the highest ranking members of the US government are powerless against it </p>
<p> There's a new Zenith popping up every single day and it's sickenening! The Zenith Fanbase thinks this will go unnoticed but I beg to differ.
	In order to protest this evergoing social issue please use #HeyThat'sNotZenith on twitter to bring awareness to the higher levels of the US Govt.
	On top of this we will be posting a brown image on Instagram on April 18th 2021 and so on. April 18th from now on will be crowned "National Zenith Day" in
	order to spread awareness for the people who have no idea. The cretins feasting of the flesh of the Zenith name will be punished... April 18th is the day.</p>

<p> This will be the image we will all use, Viva la Zenith Revelution!!!!!! </p>
