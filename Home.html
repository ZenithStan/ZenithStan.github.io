<h1> Hello, Welcome to zenithimposter.ga</h1>

<p> this is the Zenith Stan offical website!!! I'm so happy to have made it here and as a result I will be offering a virtual kiss to all of Zenith's fans if you send me a transcript of all of his videos... Including deleted and unlisted ones</p>
<h1> EVEN "DELETING IN A WEEK(UPDATE THINGY)"</h1>
<p> Anyways, I belive we should take to twitter and all other social medias availible to show our love and appreciation for our oh so handsome wholesome smol bean UwU...
<p> Our goal is for Zenith to notice us and maybe say our name in a video once! (Even in a negative context)
